# Web Component workshop
Hi, this is a very simple and easy photo-album/gallery demo made with [Lit](https://lit.dev/docs/).

## How to get started?
I'll recomend to use [Lit Playground](https://lit.dev/playground/) for this workshop. It's easy to use and won't need any setups. Playground includes basic examples and tutorials on the left sidebar, so there's like a cheat sheet to guide your work.

Lit can be also installed [locally](https://lit.dev/docs/getting-started/#install-locally-from-npm), check here if you are interested.

## TODOS
This repo contain file named photo-album.ts, it's gone be our starting file in this workshop. It's just a simple photo gallery. Your task is to play with it and add a few new features to it:

- Images should contain alt attribute which describes what image is abaout. Maybe show it over or under the big image?
- It would be nice to highlight selected thumbnail
- Some transation animations would look nice
- Styling the gallery to your liking
